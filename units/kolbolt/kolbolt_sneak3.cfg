    description= _ "Kolbolts are oviously not above dirty tactics, and Kolbolts with black fur are even more capable of using them. There is a wide number of mindsets in the culture of Kolbolts and that of the Midnights are one of the strangest. While still hiding themselves in the shadows and striking foes at their most vunrable, the Midnights will always flash their swords (to look like a full moon at midnight) before striking and will typically fight more fair than their kin. Also while they choose to fight foes directly, they also carry throwing knifes for facing archers and the like which refuse to face them directly."
