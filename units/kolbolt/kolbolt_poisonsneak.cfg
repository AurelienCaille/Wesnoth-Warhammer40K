    description= _ "Kolbolts are oviously not above dirty tactics, and Kolbolts with black fur are even more capable of using them. Just the opposite of the Midnight is the Eclipse. Not only will they sneak behind foes without warning, but they also poison their daggers with a most vile substance. It is said they are called Eclipses because of the way their poison makes the victom lose sight right before death, but this is not confirmed. Also unlike their Midnight brethern Eclipses do not carry throwing daggers either because they are so confident they can that out archers before being spotted, or because they don't want any extra weight."
